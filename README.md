# Ebot

Ebot is a small learning exercise for those who are new to Elixir. This was first used at Railscamp 18 as a "code golf" competition, where the solution for all 3 worlds managed to fit in just 7-non-semicolon-using lines of Elixir code. You don't have to do that, but if you do complete the challenges then you might want to do that as an extra thing.

Your job is to move the robot through three mazes of increasing complexity. Each maze is outlined in the test file relative to the branch. To start off however, you must spawn a bot. 

You're currently checked out to the 000-bot-spawning branch. If you run `mix test`, you'll see the test which is failing. You need to make this test pass. Once you do that, move onto the next branch: `001-world-1`, and so on until you complete all three worlds.

Good luck!
